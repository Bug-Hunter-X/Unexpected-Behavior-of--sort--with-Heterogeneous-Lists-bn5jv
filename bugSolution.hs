```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let nums :: [Int] = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNums = sort nums
  print sortedNums

  -- Example with explicit type
  let str :: [String] =  ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  let sortedStr = sort str
  print sortedStr
```
This improved version explicitly defines the type of the list (`nums :: [Int]`), thus ensuring that the `sort` function is applied to a list of comparable elements.  The compiler will now detect any attempts to include non-integer values in the `nums` list.
This explicit type declaration eliminates potential ambiguity and makes the code more robust and less susceptible to unexpected runtime errors. The addition of a String list example further demonstrates the correct usage.
