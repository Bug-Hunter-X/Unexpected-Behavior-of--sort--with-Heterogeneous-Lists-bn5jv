```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let nums = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNums = sort nums
  print sortedNums
```
This code snippet seems innocuous enough, simply sorting a list of numbers. However, a subtle issue might arise depending on the Haskell implementation and the underlying sorting algorithm used.  If the list contains elements that are not easily comparable (e.g., a mixture of numbers and strings), the `sort` function might throw an exception or produce unexpected results. The behavior isn't clearly defined in all cases for heterogeneous lists.

This issue highlights the importance of type safety in Haskell. Although the compiler might not catch this specific error during compilation (depending on the types inferred), runtime errors can occur if the input list isn't homogeneous.
